According to these relation ploted graph for understanding which is more affected for diagonosis and which is less affected.

Done mechine learning using logistic regression to predict the value and checking the prediced value how much differ from the actual value.
The aaccuracy is calculate for the model the model gives 90 percentage accuracy
 ### Tools used
